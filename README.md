#Chithi #चिठी

This repository presents the development of a messaging web app called “Chithi” that includes real-time video and voice calls, as well as an end-to-end encryption for secure communication. Chithi is built using the Django framework for the backend and React for the frontend. It incorporates WebRTC technology to enable real-time communication between users. To ensure secure communication, the app uses the Signal Protocol for end-to-end encryption, which is implemented on both the client-side and server-side of the application. The app also uses HTTPS and Let's Encrypt certificates to provide secure communication over the internet. In addition to messaging, the app allows users to initiate real-time video and voice calls, which are facilitated by the integration of WebRTC and the Janus Gateway. 

The app also incorporates features for group messaging and file sharing. The development of the app involves a range of technologies and tools, including Node.js, NPM, Webpack, Babel, SQLite, Redis, NGINX, Docker, Git, and AWS. The app was deployed to AWS for production and testing, and underwent rigorous testing to ensure its security and reliability. The resulting app provides a secure and reliable messaging platform with real-time communication capabilities, suitable for use in a variety of contexts where privacy and security are paramount concerns.
